This provides a basic user interface where you can enter two numbers and an operation to perform. It covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root. However, this is just a starting point, and you can enhance it by adding more functions, error handling, and a more user-friendly interface. Additionally, you might consider implementing a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program each time.
